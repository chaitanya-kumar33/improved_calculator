Calculator Homework README
Overview:
This repository contains my solution for the "3 Levels Of Calculator Homework" assignment given by Professor [Professor's Name]. The objective of this assignment was to design and implement a comprehensive calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and incorporating advanced features such as exception handling, object-oriented programming principles, and comprehensive testing.

My Approach:
In completing this assignment, I followed the guidelines provided by the professor:

Object-Oriented Programming Principles: I structured my code using object-oriented programming principles, including SOLID, DRY, and GRASP.
Code Organization: I organized my code into separate modules to ensure clarity and separation of concerns.
Branch Management: I followed the recommended practice of creating separate branches for each version of the program, starting with the basic implementation and gradually adding features.
Testing and Quality Assurance: I implemented comprehensive unit tests using pytest to achieve 100% test coverage. I also ensured that my code passed pylint for code quality assurance.
Exception Handling: I incorporated exception handling to handle divide by zero scenarios, ensuring the robustness of my calculator.
Repository Structure
This repository consists of three branches:

Main: Basic Calculator with fundamental functionalities.
Part 2: Intermediate Calculator with advanced functionalities and static methods.
Part 3: Advanced Calculator with detailed comments and comprehensive testing.
How to Use
To run my code and view the detailed comments and instructions, please follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the repository directory.
Check out the "PART3" branch for the most advanced version of the calculator.
Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
Install the required dependencies using pip or pip3 install requirements.txt.
Conclusion
Through this assignment, I gained valuable insights into software design principles, object-oriented programming, and unit testing practices. I believe that my solution meets the requirements outlined by the professor and demonstrates my understanding of the concepts covered in the course.
